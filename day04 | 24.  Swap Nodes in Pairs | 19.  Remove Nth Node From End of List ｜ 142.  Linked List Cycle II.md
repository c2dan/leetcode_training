# [24.  Swap Nodes in Pairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/swap-nodes-in-pairs/)

in this problem we need to swap Nodes as in pairs, this is my initial solution:
```python3
class Solution:
    def swapPairs(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        dummy = ListNode(0)
        dummy.next = head
        cur = head
        pre = dummy
        while cur and cur.next:
            tem = cur.next.next
            pre.next = cur.next
            cur.next.next = cur
            cur.next = tem
            pre = cur
            cur = tem
        return dummy.next
```
the better one is using reverse method
```python3
class Solution:
    def swapPairs(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        if head is None or head.next is None:
            return head

        # 待翻转的两个node分别是pre和cur
        pre = head
        cur = head.next
        next = head.next.next
        
        cur.next = pre  # 交换
        pre.next = self.swapPairs(next) # 将以next为head的后续链表两两交换
         
        return cur
```

# [19.  Remove Nth Node From End of List](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/)

using two pointer method。
**Solution Approach:**

1.  Initialize two pointers, `fast` and `slow`, both initially pointing to the head of the linked list.
    
2.  Move the `fast` pointer N nodes ahead. This creates a gap of N nodes between `fast` and `slow`.
    
3.  Move both `fast` and `slow` pointers one step at a time until the `fast` pointer reaches the end of the list. During this traversal, `slow` will be at the node just before the target node to be removed.
    
4.  Update the `next` pointer of the `slow` node to skip the target node, effectively removing it from the list.
    
5.  Return the head of the modified linked list.
